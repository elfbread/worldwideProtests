PROJECT DESCRIPTION TO BE UPDATED: This project includes data for the most crowded airports around the world. The user selects a region of interest (from a list provided) and the program auto-generates a line graph showing total number of passengers for airports in that region by year. Project includes a dictionary and a list, as well as a While loop.

## Start-up instructions

Before starting, you need to download/install the following extensions in VS Code for Jupyter Notebook:

![Jupyter extension](extension.png)

Clone the repo to your computer. 

Package requirements are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install the libraries in the requirements.txt file using the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Packages include:
- Pandas

Navigate to the folder and open main.ipynb with VS Code. Be sure to update the kernel in the upper right of VS Code (as shown in the screenshot below).The file import uses a public CSV saved in Google Sheets, a work around for users utilizing different operating systems (not having to adjust the import statement/file path).
## Important - be sure to update the kernel to the venv you are using in the upper right corner of VS Code (screenshot for assistance below):
